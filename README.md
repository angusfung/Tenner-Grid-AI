# Tenner-Grid-AI
AI for the game Tenner Grid by means of modelling it as a constraint-satisfication problem using BT, FC, GAC with MRV heuristic.

# To Run:
1. Clone repository
2. cd to working directory
3. python3 tenner_sample_run.py
4. Add additional problems to tenner_sample_run.py if desired. 

Will need to configure python3 as an environmental variable, otherwise, run it from an IDE.
